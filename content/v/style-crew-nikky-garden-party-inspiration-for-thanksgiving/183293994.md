    "description": "I had the opportunity to watch a charity fashion event sponsored by my local store Macy’s Los Cerritos in partnership with Jewish Family and Children Services. It was a night of fashion and glamour! I was so inspired by the fashion that I decided to throw a garden party themed for Thanksgiving! I’m grabbing one of the looks off the runway as my outfit for Thanksgiving. Find your fashion inspiration for Thanksgiving and shop now!",
