    "description": "Did I mention I love animal prints?\nSure I am a plus size woman, but I am not afraid of print, color or pattern!\nThere are some amazing plus size pieces at Macy's that feel young and fresh, like this City Chic animal print dress. It's light and comfortable and stylish too! Don't forget the perfect coat from INC and my favorite handbag from Micheal Kors",
