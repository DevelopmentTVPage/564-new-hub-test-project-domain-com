I am obsessing over these William Rast destructed denim shorts and they are my new go-to from brunch with my girls to day time dates with bae and even a night out, because who says you can’t dress up denim?!? I’m also in love with this off the shoulder flounce dress from Rachel Roy. The movement around the neck and shoulders is so flirty and fun and the material is so light weight making it perfect for summer. Last but not least, there are pockets in this dress, I repeat: pockets in the dress!!!",
