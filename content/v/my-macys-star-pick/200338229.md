    "description": "It's Taco Tuesday and there's no better way to whip up the most amazing taco's after work than to use an instant pot! I love making dishes in my instant pot weekly but taco's are one of my favorites. I love super yummy, savory meat for my tacos, especially that all day slow cooking taste.I just sometimes don't get my dish in the slow cooker in time before I leave for work. The instant pot is the perfect alternative. You can have delicious taco meat of your choice in the instant pot in a matter of minutes! That's why the instant pot is my Macy's Star Pick.",
