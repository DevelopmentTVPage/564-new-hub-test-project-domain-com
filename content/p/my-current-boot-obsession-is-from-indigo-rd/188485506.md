    "description": "This image is taken from my view because I cant stop looking at them. They look very similar to the Marc Fisher boots but at 1\/3 of the price!!\n\nThey are comfy, chic and warm! They're keeping my feet warm in these cold NYC nights! Don't miss the sale on these babies! Thank me later :-)",
