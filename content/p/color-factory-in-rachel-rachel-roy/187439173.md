    "description": "I was recently able to check out the Chicago-native interactive exhibit, The Color Factory, when it came to NYC! In order to pop in my photos in the various saturated rooms, I opted for this white, lightweight denim jacket from Rachel Rachel Roy, available exclusively at Macy's. Is anyone else as crazy about the varsity trend as I am?
