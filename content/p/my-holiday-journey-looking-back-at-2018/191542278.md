    "description": "I’m Beary excited about the week between Christmas and New Years (and my birthday). I look back at the year and remember all the things I’ve accomplished. My career at Macy’s began and I joined the Macy’s Style Crew was among some of them!!  I’ve got a lot ahead of me and I cannot wait to see what 2019 brings. Hopefully more Bear Sweaters and a tropical vacation!!",
