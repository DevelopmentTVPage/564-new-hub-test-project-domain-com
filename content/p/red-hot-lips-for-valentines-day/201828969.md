    "description": "Jamie at Impulse Beauty Wolfchase gave me this amazing red lip using Anastasia, Tarte and Smashbox products and I’m in LOVE!!!\n\nFirst, she prepped my lips with Tarte Pout Prep Lip Exfoliant, then she used Anastasia Lip Primer and followed with Anastasia Liquid Lipstick in American Doll (bonus! This color does help make your teeth look whiter!). She use Smashbox’s Lip Pencil to finish off the look and make sure my lips were perfectly blended. ",
