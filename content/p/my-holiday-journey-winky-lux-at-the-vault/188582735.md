    "description": "Meet my new obsession - Winky Lux Glimmer Balm. I fell in love with this on a girls trip to NYC.  Goes on clear then reacts to your skins pH levels to create a hint of glimmer, leaving your lips the perfect shade of pink.  I was truly impressed that it lasts all day! Makes a great stocking stuffer.",
