    "description": "I get to spend Thanksgiving in sunny South Florida this year. Usually it's a little chilly but not too bad. We might be in the low 70's this year! This Alfani Sweater (web id 6745668)  is perfect paired with high waisted denim. It's cozy and perfect to stay busy in because I'm always in the kitchen on Thanksgiving day! I love this sweater so much because the faux fur cuff detailing makes it a little festive for the season without over doing it!",
