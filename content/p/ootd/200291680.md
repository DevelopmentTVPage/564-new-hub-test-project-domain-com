    "description": "A chilly morning calls for cashmere!  Cashmere sweater - Macy's exclusive (the blue I'm wearing is on sale for $35!!!) and CK scarf that I use in the summer as a cover-up.  Who doesn't love items that are multi-season\/purpose?  Joe's Jeans are my favorite brand of jeans.  And Nine West boots complete the look. Similar boots web id: 6643128",
