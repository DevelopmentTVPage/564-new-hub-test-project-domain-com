    "description": "My drive to work is beautiful. Often, I think to myself I should get out of the car, look around, take some pictures…but I never do. I tell myself I’ll do it another time, but I never do. I tell myself I’ll draw or paint that landscape, but I never do. This year, I’m going to stop saying I’ll do it later. Time is flying by way too fast; later may never come. That is my New Year’s Resolution: don’t do it later, do it now. ",
