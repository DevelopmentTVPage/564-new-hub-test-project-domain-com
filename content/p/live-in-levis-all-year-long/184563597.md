    "description": "Did you know Levis sold more than just jeans in plus size?\nTheir hoodies, tees and coats are so much fun and give me all the 90s vibes\nCheck out a few of my favorite pieces including the wedgie jean, the perfect hoodie and this novelty puffer coat, all available at Macys in the plus size department and on Macys.com\n\nThis kind of look is certainly a weekend go-to for me during the colder months. I like to layer up so that when I go inside I can take off my coat but still maintain the vibe of my outfit.",
