    "description": "As we close out 2018, I like to look back at all of the fun times and amazing adventures I've been on! I'm already excited for the places I'll be traveling to in 2019! One of my favorite destinations is the mountains for a taste of winter, some skiing and of course apr√®s ski! This requires a chic winter wardrobe and practical snow boots which is why I'm so happy we now have Sorel at Macy's!! They make my favorite, fashionable winter boots. ",
