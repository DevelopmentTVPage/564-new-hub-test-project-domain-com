    "description": "All the touristy things for our girls trip to NYC.  In the early 20th century, this was the largest Public Health Service facility in the United States.  You have to be dressed appropriately for the weather on the New York Harbor.  The buildings are not climate controlled.  I stayed warm with my MK down jacket, Adidas headband, sherpa fleece and Sperry duck boots!",
