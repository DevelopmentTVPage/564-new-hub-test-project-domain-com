    "description": "I just finished my first bottle of Good Genes Lactic Acid Treatment from Sunday Riley & I’m so happy I had my backup ready! This has been my go to product the last 2 months and is what I call a “facial in a bottle!” In just 2 months my skin has become so radiant and even! My scars from my hormonal breakouts on my jaw are nearly gone, my pores are smaller, and I’m glowing like never before! Great for all skin types, including sensitive skin! This is something I think everyone should have in their routine in 2019!",
