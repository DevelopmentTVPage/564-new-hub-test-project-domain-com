    "description": "The water has such a nice way of refreshing me all year long. In the summer I love to swim in it and in the colder months, just being near it is calming and revitalizing! I love going for a walk with the breeze in my hair and the ocean breeze on my face and Nike plus size gear helps keep me moving. I am obsessed with these new green pieces for fall that are available in plus sizes at Macys.",
