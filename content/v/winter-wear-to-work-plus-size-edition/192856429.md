    "description": "In the winter time its easy to throw on a big cozy sweater and your favorite leggings or ponte pants and head in to the office, but sometimes it's fun to dress it up and try hard not to throw on all black! I love these deep green pants with a fuzzy and cozy sweater paired with a snake boot to make it feel a little funky. I also grabbed my beige coat because I can't be in all black all the time! These plus size pieces are all available at your local Macys or on Macys.com",
