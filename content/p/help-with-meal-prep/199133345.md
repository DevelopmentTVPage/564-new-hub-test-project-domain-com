    "description": "Saturday I boiled some chicken and used my Kitchen Aid mixer to shred it.  So easy.  I let the chicken cool for about 20 mins then used the paddle attachment to shred for about a min - it will depend how much chicken you have for how long it will take but let me tell you - so much easier than shredding by hand!  This made enough chicken for a few lunches this week - I wait until that day to decide what I want to season it with or how to use it.  Gives you flexibility and variety!",
