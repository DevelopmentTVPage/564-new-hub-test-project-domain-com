    "description": "Kerry Washington's most recent Broadway play, American Son, was nothing short of brilliant and heartbreaking. Although Netflix has just announced the amazing news that they will be adapting the play into a show with its original Broadway cast, I can't help but wish I could have seen it a second time! For this suspenseful show, that left us all on the edge of our seats, I opted for a comfortable statement with Bar III's faux-wrap wide-leg pants.
