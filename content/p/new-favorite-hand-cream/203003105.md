    "description": "I love using hand cream.... especially in the winter. I cannot stand the feeling of dry hands! I have used so many different kinds over the years and the AHAVA Mineral Hand Cream is my new personal fav! I first tried this hand cream when I got a tube in my Fab Fit Fub subscription box and was so excited to see that Macyâ€™s carries it! It contains Aloe Vera extract to soothe and provide natural moisture, Witch Hazel extracts to smooth skin, & allantoin to heal dry, cracked skin. The scent is very light and fresh... it kind of smells like baby lotion to me which I love the smell of! It also comes in a few other new scents: Prickly Pear & Moringa, Mandarin & Cedarwood, and Cactus & Pink Pepper! If you deal with dry cracked hands during the winter, try this stuff out!",
