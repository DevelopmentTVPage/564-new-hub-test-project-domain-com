    "description": "Origins has been a go-to brand of mine for YEARS! These products will always have a place on my vanity because they are AMAZING! First, the Checks and Balances frothy face wash is by FAR the best I have ever used. It leaves my skin feeling super clean and refreshed! Follow up a clean face with either the Clear Improvements Charcoal mask or the Retexturizing Mask with Rose Clay! Both are perfect and keep your skin FRESH and REVITALIZED! ",
