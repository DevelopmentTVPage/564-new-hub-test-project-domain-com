    "description": "I personally love when New York apartments leave up their holiday decor up during January.\n\n The next few months will be a bit boring with nothing to look forward to but that doesn't mean your outfits have to be blah. My outfit is a perfect winter weekend look to grab drinks with friends or visit an art museum. The bag was gifted from one of my old co-workers and is a perfect backpack to fit all your necessities but still small enough to carry around. My favorite piece is the Bar III patent jacket. I can style the jacket with jeans and a graphic tee or dress it up like what i am wearing in the video.\n\nWeb IDs:\nJacket: 6939241\nBag: 7093240\n\n\nThanks for watching :)",
