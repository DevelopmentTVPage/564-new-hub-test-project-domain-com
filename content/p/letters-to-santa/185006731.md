    "description": "Are these shoes not the most ADORABLE little things you have ever seen? You all know how festive I am so when I saw these Charter Club beauties (in my own area!) I HAD to have them!\n-\nAlso, I was so excited to send out another letter to Santa because last time I asked for Peter Kavinsky (Hi Noah Centineo ??) but today I asked for something I’ve been missing out on for a very long time living on a tropical island and that is the wonder of SNOW?? and what makes these letters even more special is that every letter written will equal $1 donated to Make-A-Wish up to $1M ??\n-\nI also wanted to show you all these super cute Christmas cards that we sell in store provided by Papyrus! You can use them to hold your gift cards or your cash and\/or write a special message when you give them to the special people in your life! Check out @macys Guam to grab all these products because they are available in store now! Or, if you’re not about the in-store life (because same) shoot me a message or comment below if you want any of these items and I’ll provide you with the links! Happy Holidays to all you lovely people! ????",
