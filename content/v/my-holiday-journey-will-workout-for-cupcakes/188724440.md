    "description": "Will trade squats for cupcakes \nOver the last year I moved to a new state and had to join a new gym after leaving the one I worked and worked out in, for almost 16 years.  This time last year, I hired a personal trainer to help me adjust fitness and nutrition to a life style, instead of falling flat for fad diets and workout trends. Mixing it up from calisthenics, strength training, HIIT cardio and even boxing, I needed my clothes withstand vigorous movements and keep certain body parts in place (ladies, you know what i mean ) The DKNY active collection @macys totally has me sold. I love their sports bras that, while cute, maintain their functionality for low impact, mobility and cool comfort. \nShop this  iconic DKNY look and others like it, now @macys! \n#fitnessfriday#mystyle#macys#macysstylecrew#Nike\n#DKNY\nShop the LINK in my bio to get these awesome items!",
