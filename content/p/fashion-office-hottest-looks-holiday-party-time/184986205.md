I am seriously having a sequin moment and this Adrianna Papell sequin dress is making my life easier when it comes to getting ready for a party! I throw on statement coat and i'm instantly ready to go. If i'm feeling a little edgy, I'll even pair with a cute white sneaker, but i'll always make sure to grab accessories that shine!",
