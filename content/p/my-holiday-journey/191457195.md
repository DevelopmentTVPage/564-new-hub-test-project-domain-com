    "description": "One of my favorite memories this holiday season was getting my photo taken with Kris Kringle at #macyssantaland!!! The best part is that I was able to drop off a letter to Santa. For every letter, @macys will donate $1 for Make-A-Wish to grant the wishes of children with critical illnesses. It feels good to work for a company that gives back! ",
