    "description": "Had a check in with my trainer this morning. It was rainy so I figured I’d go for comfort today. If you haven’t tried them yet, you need to. So incredibly soft! I love how yoou can dress them up with booties or down with sneakers...or rain boots in my case since it’s raining in Cincy! (However, I won’t be wearing them all day - I brought black booties with me)  If you’re short like me, I’d recommend the petite. Otherwise, TTS!  The picture doesn't do them justice either - they have a shine to them!",
