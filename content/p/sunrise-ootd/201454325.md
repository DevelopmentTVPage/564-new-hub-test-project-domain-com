    "description": "It's going to be almost 60 degrees today in Cincinnati.  This lightweight American Rag cardigan is perfect for today.  Paired with high-rise flare jeans.  These are similar to the Hudson ones I tagged.  And if you haven't tried Hudson jeans yet - you need to.  They are the softest and the quality is unreal.  They last forever!",
