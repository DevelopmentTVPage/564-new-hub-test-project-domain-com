    "description": "When we moved into our new home in the Fall, I wanted to get a few new pieces to spruce up our kitchen and I am loving these Martha Stewart finds! The wire paper towel older & fruit basket fit perfectly with the modern farmhouse look I was going for! The matte black finish is so modern chic! Great deals on these pieces today with the home sale! This collection also carries a wire utensil crock & napkin holder (sold out).",
