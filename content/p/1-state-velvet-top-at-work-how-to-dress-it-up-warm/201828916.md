    "description": "My 1.STATE Velvet top arrived!! My original plan was to wear it for my Valentine's Day Date with the hubby (still the plan) but I was dying to wear it to work today! Since it's cold in Cincinnati again I paired the top with a open front duster cardigan, a blanket scarf, and my favorite booties (color taupe - TTS). Topped the look off with some gold jewelry!!",
