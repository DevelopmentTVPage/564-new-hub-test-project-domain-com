    "description": "Here are some of my favorite products from this week! Clinique ID is still blowing my mind with how amazing it feels and looks on my skin. The Urban Decay Razor Sharp liner has the perfect hair-tip brush, amazing for winged liner. And lastly, Iâ€™m obsessed with the Shiseido ModernMatte lipstick. It lasts super long and the color range is lovely!",
