    "description": "It’s okay to skip the red & green décor this holiday season and go straight for the white. This leather all-white Eames inspired recliner & Ottoman adds an effortlessly luxury dimension to your living space in a way that will impress your guests far into the New Year. I am channeling my inner Miles Davis this season with the monochrome sensuality in men's tailored clothing\/suits (Bar III) paired with the essential refined Alfani turtleneck. Focus on the details with basic accessories and get some more use out of your tie bars by clipping it to your suit lapel. Continue the monochrome in your grey textured Kenneth Cole NY dress shoes with novelty socks and you will feel both modern & soulful. Grey-scale is the color scheme of a Soul Charismas even when you run out of the patience for anymore red & green Christmas trim.",
