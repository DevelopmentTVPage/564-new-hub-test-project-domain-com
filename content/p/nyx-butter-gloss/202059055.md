    "description": "I have tried tons of lip glosses and this one is by far my favorite! I love that it’s not sticky and the formula goes on smooth and looks great! It comes in 22 beautiful shades. My favorite right now is “Tiramisu” (pictured) but I also am loving “Angel Food Cake” and “Creme Brulee” (I love a neutral pink). For only $5 this lip gloss is a must have!!!",
