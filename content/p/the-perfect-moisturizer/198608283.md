    "description": "If you live in a dry climate like me, I’m sure you are always in search for the perfect moisturizer.  We moved to Colorado a little over a year ago and my skin went from east coast hydrated to literally flaking off.  I started upping my water intake and still didn’t see a difference.  After months of trying over 20 different products, I finally found a winner!  Thanks Clinique for saving my skin.  Stop by Macy’s and ask for a free sample.  Link is in my bio.\n#hydration #moisturizer #mountainliving #outdoorlife #clinique #macysbeauty #macysstylecrew",
