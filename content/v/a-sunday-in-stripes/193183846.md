    "description": "Weekends are for catching up in so many different ways; catching up with friends, catching up on chores, or catching up on your favorite hobbies! When I'm out and about I like to be comfortable and cute and this Rachel Roy plus size striped set is perfect for just that! I threw on my favorite Steve madden boots and Vince Camuto jacket to complete my look and it was perfect for a Sunday in New York City",
