Round up your in-store purchases to the nearest dollar (up to $0.99) and donate the change to Go Red. Funds support education, resources, and tools for women to improve their health & well being through physical activity \n4 weeks into my MAX challenge @maxofsayerville helping me achieve my goals, stay healthy and get strong.\n#goredforwomen#gored#makegoodcents\n#macysstylecrew#macys#fitness#health\n#thefutureisfemale#diva#ladyboss",
