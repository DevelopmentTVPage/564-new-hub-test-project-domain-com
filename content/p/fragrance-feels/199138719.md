    "description": "Discover the new fragrance JOY by Dior. The feeling of joy is finally captured in a perfume with enveloping softness and energy. Shining with the vibrant smile of flowers and citrus fruits, the smooth caress of wood, and the serenity of musks, the fragrance is faceted with a thousand enveloping nuances that lead to a clean, simple expression. Spray lightly on pulse points morning and evening. \"\"JOY by Dior expresses the remarkable feeling of joy through an interpretation of light. This perfume resembles certain pointillist paintings that are rich with a precise, yet not too obvious, technique. This perfume is constructed in a similar manner thanks to multiple nuances and myriad facets, which lead to a crystal-clear fragrance expression.\" Fran√ßois Demachy, In-House Perfumer-Creator\"\n\nTop Notes: Zested Bergamot and Mandarin\nMiddle Notes: Rose and Jasmine Absolute\nBase: Warm and Creamy Sandalwood Evanescent Musks",
