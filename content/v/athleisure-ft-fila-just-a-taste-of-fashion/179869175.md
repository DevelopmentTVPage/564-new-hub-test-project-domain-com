    "description": "Comfort is key for the days I am constantly on my feet running errands, but I still want to look put together and on trend. So how exactly do I do that? Glad you asked. Athleisure is a fun way to wear athletic clothes when not working out but still have a little oomph in your outfit. Fila is one of my favorite brands at Macy's to shop for my athleisure days due to bold prints and mix and match pieces.  I am excited to show you two styles I am wearing today, but don't fret,there are plenty of styles to choose from. All styles are shoppable on your right screen. \nThanks for watching!",
