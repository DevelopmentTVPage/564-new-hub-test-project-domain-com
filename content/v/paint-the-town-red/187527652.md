    "description": "As new yorkers, it is really easy to fall into the cycle of wearing all black all the time, especially as winter rolls around. I like to spice things up and throw in a bit of pizzazz and pop with fun details and bright colors. I took these INC plus size ponte pants with a sequin tuxedo stripe and paired them back to a basic black chiffon tank and red faux fur coat, also from INC to make this fun and fabulous winter look. It's easy to take this out fit from cubicle to cocktails any day!",
