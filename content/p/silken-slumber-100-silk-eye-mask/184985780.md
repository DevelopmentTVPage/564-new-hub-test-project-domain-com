    "description": "I just tried out this product for the first time and it is AMAZING! This eye mask is 100% silk, hypoallergenic, moisture wicking, machine washable, and breathable! I used this for when I had a really bad migraine to block out the light, and it actually soothed me because it’s so soft! Another night I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the day! It’s so comfortable on; you actually forget it’s there! This is a GREAT holiday gift for a loved one who loses sleep, has migraines, or just someone who loves to be pampered! ",
