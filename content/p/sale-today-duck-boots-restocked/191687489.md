    "description": "To be honest, at first I thought these boots were not my style.  But then I found the quilted black.  I needed some new waterproof rain\/snow boots so I thought I'd give them a try.  9 times out of 10 when I where them walking into work, I never put my other shoes on.  They are so comfy...and cute!  Now you can get them too.  They are restocked! And on sale through today!!!",
