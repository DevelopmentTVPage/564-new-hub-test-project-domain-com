    "description": "I originally bought this mask to be used as ... a mask (obviously) but after waking up the other day with the most painful breakout under my chin imaginable, I thought \"if this can deep clean pores and remove toxins\/debris, maybe it can be used as a spot treatment, too?\" so I tried it and let. me. tell. you. the next morning the breakout was so much smaller, less red, and sooo much less painful. After two nights using it as a treatment, the breakout is basically gone. I'm seriously so happy I figured this out. If you're looking for a product that you can easily turn into a 2 in 1, BUY THIS!",
