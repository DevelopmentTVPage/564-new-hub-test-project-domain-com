    "description": "Animal print comes in all shapes and sizes and color, but when I'm running around the city on the weekends, this New York Collection Sweater is perfect to throw on with a cute t-shirt and a great pair of casual pants, like these olive green joggers from Style and Co. Make sure to grab a stand out accessory too, I recommend a red handbag",
