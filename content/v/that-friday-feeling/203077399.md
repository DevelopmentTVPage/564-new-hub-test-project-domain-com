    "description": "Hello & Happy Friday!  Just have to share with you this MUST HAVE cropped hoodie from Under Armour.  I fell in love with this hoodie in NYC.  It was on a mannequin and I knew I had to have it.  I love the pink because you can see the detail so much more than you can in black. Need to buy the black one too  as it would go more with all my fun leggings!  This is perfect for the gym or running errands.  I wear it either way!  Tagging the joggers too :)  Oh and you guessed it - both are on sale!",
