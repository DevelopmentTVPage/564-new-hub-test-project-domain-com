    "description": "You guys!  Two products I CANNOT live without are: Benefit BROWVO! Conditioning Primer and It Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereye concealer.  I use the brow conditioner morning and night - it really helps keep your brows full.  The undereye concealer is a must, especially for the full-time working mom.  I've also tagged my favorite eyebrow pencil, eye shadow primer, blush, mascara and concealer for redness or blemishes.",
