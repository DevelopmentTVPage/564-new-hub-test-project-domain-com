    "description": "Hi Guys! I'm back again with another cute outfit from Macy's. I recently discovered that Betsey Johnson has a plus size collection. I was completely surprised when I found that out and I love it! I love prints and prints are in. Here we have polka dots! It's cute, playful, and fun. Pair it up with boots and a leather jacket as well. Perfect for work or play. Be sure to tag me in your posts. Thanks",
