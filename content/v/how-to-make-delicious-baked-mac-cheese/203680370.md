    "description": "This super easy mac and cheese recipe was made possible by great cooking tools such as the Ayesha Curry Cookware collection. I love using her Porcelain Enamel Nonstick 5.5-qt Covered Straining Casserole. I love that I can prepare my noodles in this pot and also strain it in the same pot! Amazing time saver. In addition, because it's nonstick, I can prepare my cheese sauce in the same pot! This is a must have for any kitchen. ",
