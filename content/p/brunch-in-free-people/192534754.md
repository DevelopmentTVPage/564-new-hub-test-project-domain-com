    "description": "This weekend, I checked out a chic, 70's inspired restaurant for brunch in the West Village appropriately dubbed Due West. Along with assistance from my chilled espresso cocktail, I was able to beat the heat with Free People's cosy and femme Linen Midi Dress, available now at Macy's. Check out the link in my bio for all shopping details to purchase this beauty! [Exact Match has since sold out; a similar style is now linked.]",
