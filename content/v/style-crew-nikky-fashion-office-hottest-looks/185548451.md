    "description": "Watch this transformation we did at our Los Cerritos Center store with the help of my crew our styling team Impulse Counter Manager Adrianna and Social Media influencer Kaitlin Villasuso we gave out local “hero” Theresa a day to night look! She came in wanting a day at the boardroom and meetings to a night out with the girls\/mommy break at night. First thing that came to my mind is she needs a Party Classic Chic outfit that will suit her from day to night! Enjoy this video as much as we enjoyed glamming her up. Theresa volunteers for Safe Passages which is a non profit that helps domestic violence survivors. It was a great pleasure helping one of our heroes in need of a makeover because that is the Magic of Macy’s! Spoiler alert you might cry at the end of the video because we suprise her with a Macy’s shopping money. #MacysGivesBack $ <3",
