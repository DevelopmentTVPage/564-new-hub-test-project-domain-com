    "description": "Join me in Fitting room Looks for YOU: denim jacket Layering edition. Showing you three ways to layer up this fall, especially those chilly days. Teaming it with black skinny jeans, and my Calvin Klein Dad Sneakers, I couldn't feel more fall ready. The Calvin Klein colored blocked denim jacket (6815009) has to be added to your closet, I'm a sucker for a good hoodie and this Buckhorn Brown Puma hoodie (4746511) fulfilled that obsession.  Fall fashion is really super dope and the layering has to be my favorite, be sure to follow @Mr_TJay!",
