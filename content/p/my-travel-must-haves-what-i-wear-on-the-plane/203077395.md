    "description": "These items are a Must Have for airplane travel!! We leave for FL tomorrow and I have my Camo Spanx leggings ready to go! These are a customer favorite and they are perfectly comfortable for the plane - especially if you're flying with a toddler (like me). I love to pair the leggings with a fun graphic tee and easy slide-on casual sneakers! Also, a plane ride wouldn't be complete without a BEAUTIFUL carry-on bag filled with stickers, coloring books, and snacks for your kid(s)!! ",
