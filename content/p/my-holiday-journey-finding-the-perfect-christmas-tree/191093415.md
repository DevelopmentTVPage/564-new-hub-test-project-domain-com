    "description": "I love finding the perfect Christmas tree to decorate. We always get ours from the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 717. They have the best price, freshly cut and it goes to a great cause.  When looking at the Christmas trees I always say, the taller the better!! Featuring this Moose Sweater is by Weatherproof Vintage.
